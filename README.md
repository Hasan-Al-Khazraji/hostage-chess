### Special Rules of Hostage Chess ðŸ“œ

1. **Capturing Pieces**: When a piece is captured, it is not removed from the game. Instead, it is placed in the capturing player's "prison".
2. **Reintroducing Pieces**: Captured pieces can be reintroduced to the board by the capturing player on their turn. The piece can be placed on any empty square.
3. **Promotion**: Pawns can be promoted to any piece when they reach the opposite end of the board.
4. **Airfield**: Pieces can be dropped from the airfield onto the board, similar to reintroducing captured pieces.
5. **Hostage Exchange**: Players can exchange pieces between their prison and airfield, allowing for strategic reintroductions.
